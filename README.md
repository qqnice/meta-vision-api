Meta Glasses 雷朋眼鏡 串接 ChatGPT作法

# Meta Vision 
### Meta Glasses GPT4 Vision API Implementation

This is a hacky way to integrate GPT4 Vision into the Meta Rayban Smart Glasses using voice commands.

[Example Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiEDrcLCmew)

Requirements:

a) [Meta Rayban Smart Glasses](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/new-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/)

b) [OpenAi Api Key](https://platform.openai.com/)

c) Alternative Facebook/Messenger account

d) [bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Setup

#### Get the server up and running:

1) Add a .env file with your OpenAi API key (example via ``env.example``)

2) Run ``bun install``

3) Run ``bun run dev``

4) Server should be up and running on PORT 3103

#### Add the Messenger Chat Observer:

**WARNING**: bookmarklets are a slightly obscure and very hacky way to execute arbitrary javascript in your browser, before running **MAKE SURE** to check the code you're executing. 
The bookmarklet code is documented below in the section titled: **Bookmarklet Code Breakdown**

1) Login to [messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com) with an alternative messenger/facebook account (make sure you are friends with your main account that's logged into your meta view app)

2) Copy and paste the code from ``bookmarklet.js`` and create a new bookmark in your browser with the URL as the code (alternatively import it as a bookmark)

3) Click the newly created bookmark

4) Upon success a dialog should appear with **Added Messenger Chat Observer**

#### Test the integration:

1) Make sure within the Meta View app that the messenger connection is connected to the appropriate main account

2) Say ``You: Hey Meta, send a photo to *name of alternative account*``

3) `Meta: Send a photo to *name of alternative account*`

4) ``You: Yes``

5) Upon receiving the new photo and sending it to GPT4 Vision the server should display the following logs:

```
GPT4 Vision Request
Sending request to GPT4 Vision
Request Successful
Saving data
Reading stored data
Creating new data file.
Writing new data
```
6) Open up ``./public/data.json`` to check the successful added data

ENJOY!

#### Bookmarklet Code Breakdown:

```javascript
javascript: (function (s) {
  //This a bookmarklet that you can either import as a bookmark
  //OR you can copy all the code and paste into the URL when making a new bookmark
  //OR post in dev console

  // This is designed to observe for any new photo messages that are sent in messenger and then to forward the image url to this projects REST api

  const messages = document.getElementsByClassName("x78zum5 xdt5ytf x1iyjqo2 xs83m0k x1xzczws x6ikm8r x1rife3k x1n2onr6 xh8yej3")[1].childNodes[2];

  // This is to find the messages container within messenger.com for the selected chat

  // However, these obfuscated classes are subject to change and so this is likely to break in the near future

  messages.removeEventListener("DOMNodeInserted", null);

  // The utilization of DOMNodeInserted is very bad practice and will be deprecated in all browsers in the future

  // Mutation observer should replace DOMNodeInserted
  messages.addEventListener("DOMNodeInserted", async (event) => {
    const imgSrc = event?.target?.getElementsByTagName("img")[1]?.src;
    if (imgSrc) {
      const res = await fetch("http://localhost:3103/api/gpt-4-vision", {
        method: "POST",

        //Facebook's image urls contains lots of properties that need to be perfectly preserved in order to view the image
        body: JSON.stringify({ imageUrl: imgSrc }),
        mode: "no-cors",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
      });
      const data = res.json();
      console.log(data);
    }
  });
  alert("Added Messenger Chat Observer");
})();
```

Please reach out if there are any issues or feature requests :)

Hopefully the Meta Reality Labs team will provide an SDK in the future so these types of integrations can be ✨productionised✨
